## Instructions for playing
When you launch the game, select one of the three musical instruments you want to play with: Piano, Guitar or Trumpet. 
Each of them is associated to a geometrical shape and a color that you can personalize according to your synesthetic perception by tapping “Settings” in the Home screen:
- to exchange the shapes, make a long tap and drag it under another instrument
- to change the color, make a short tap on the shape and choose from the palette that will appear
Set the difficulty level in the Home screen and tap on the “Start” button.

You see a row of grey spots that you will have to fill with the appropriate sequence of notes by selecting them from the musical scale in the lower row.

With “Listen” you hear the original sequence, then you can try the notes in the musical scale as many times as you need to find the matching sounds. Place them at the right position in the upper row (tap on the note in lower row and then tap on the position)
Tap “Play” to hear your notes sequences.
Tap “Solution” to see the solution of the game.

You have a limited number of “Listen” depending on the difficulty level. You win the game if you match the original notes sequence within this limit.

## Technical requirements
The game was made in Swift Playground using Xcode 10.1
