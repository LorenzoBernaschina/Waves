## Overview
“Waves” is a music game designed to be used at any age but especially meant to develop kids skills, within a simple rule: you have to reproduce the same sequence of notes randomly generated by the game.


## Educational proposition
The aim is to improve people’s aural skills and synesthetic perceptions, very important both for musicians and in the everyday life.

Synesthesia is a condition in which the person experiences a combination of the senses: this game focuses in particular on chromesthesia in which the melody evokes the perception of a color.

Although some people think it is a rare and innate skill, synesthesia can be strengthened by repeated exposure to combined perceptual features at key developmental stages and can lead to remarkable cognitive abilities, including creativity and memory.

People with synesthesia see the world differently and many composers and artists, including Leonardo Da Vinci, have described their experiences with it.

This is why I would like to engage people through the game, making them learn in a simpler and fun way.


## Instructions for playing
When you launch the game, select one of the three musical instruments you want to play with: Piano, Guitar or Trumpet. 
Each of them is associated to a geometrical shape and a color that you can personalize according to your synesthetic perception by tapping “Settings” in the Home screen:
- to exchange the shapes, make a long tap and drag it under another instrument
- to change the color, make a short tap on the shape and choose from the palette that will appear
Set the difficulty level in the Home screen and tap on the “Start” button.

You see a row of grey spots that you will have to fill with the appropriate sequence of notes by selecting them from the musical scale in the lower row.

With “Listen” you hear the original sequence, then you can try the notes in the musical scale as many times as you need to find the matching sounds. Place them at the right position in the upper row (tap on the note in lower row and then tap on the position)
Tap “Play” to hear your notes sequences.
Tap “Solution” to see the solution of the game.

You have a limited number of “Listen” depending on the difficulty level. You win the game if you match the original notes sequence within this limit.

## Technical accomplishments
I used AVFoundation to make music effects and UIKit to manage animations.

The contents are made by myself: I used GarageBand for the music samples and Sketch for the icons and graphics.

The software has been developed to easily support more instruments, shapes and colors in the future.

As a mid-term goal, I want to improve the quality of sounds and make the game a supportive tool even for music therapists.

I hope you’ll like it.
